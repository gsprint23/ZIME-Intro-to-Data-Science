    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson is going to be a collection of online resources for learning about Git and Github. While it is important to learn the fundamentals of these tools by reading the following materials, the best way to learn is to actually play with these tools. Follow along on your own machine where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version Control\n",
    "From the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control):\n",
    ">What is \"version control\", and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. \n",
    "\n",
    ">If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a popular VCS that is the version control software that GitHub is built on. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. People from all over the world (or in the exact same place) can work together on projects. Code that is hosted on GitHub can be either public or private.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "First, make a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, follow this Hello World tutorial on Github: [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). This tutorial walks you through the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a repository. A repository is a folder that organizes your GitHub project. Files and folders in your repository are version controlled. You should always include a README.md file in each of your repositories. README files are markdown files (yay!) that describe your repository. Read more about README.md files [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/). \n",
    "1. Create a branch. A branch is a version of the repository that someone is working on. The \"master\" branch of your repository is the main branch. When you are going to work on a new feature of the software, you will make a new branch off of the master branch. This new branch is a copy of the master branch. When you are done implementing your new feature, you merge your branch back into master.\n",
    "1. Create a commit. A commit is a change to file(s) in the repository that you want to save.\n",
    "1. Create a pull request. When you make a pull request, you are asking someone to pull in your proposed changes from your branch to be merged with another branch (usually master). \n",
    "1. Merge a pull request."

    "## Making a Personal Access Token\n",
    "Throughout the steps below, you may be prompted to authenticate with your Github username and password. For your password, you will need to make a personal access token. Instructions to do this are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Be sure to check the box for \"repo\" scope. I recommend saving your personal access token so you can easily access it when needed later."

    "## Common Git Commands\n",
    "So far, we have been using GitHub via its browser interface for simple non-code edits. More commonly, you will be writing code locally on your machine. You will then want to push the code changes from your local repository to the repository on GitHub via a graphical user interface (GUI) tool or the command line interface. In this class, we will use the VS Code GUI tools; however, if you know how to use the command line, I highly recommend you use the command line for great practice and more control over your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a git repository (`init` command)\n",
    "    1. In VS code, open the version control panel on the left side of the app \n",

    "## Git Ignore Files\n",
    "Files that end in .gitignore contain rules for files/folders that git should ignore, meaning not put under version control. This is nice if you typically always add all files for staging (e.g. `git add -A` or `git add .`) instead of individual ones. Here are a few examples of files and folders you might want to have git ignore in this class:\n",

    "* .ipynb_checkpoints\n",
    "* DS_Store\n",
    "* .vscode\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating a .gitignore file from scratch, head over to https://github.com/github/gitignore and find a standard .gitignore file for the kind of project/programming language you are working on. Then you can customize for your project. For this class, it is convenient to start with the Python.gitignore: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend adding a .gitignore to your repository when you create it. Otherwise you'll have to remove files from git using `git rm --cached [filenames]` or `git rm -r --cached .` to remove all files. Then add the .gitignore file and you can add files for tracking again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caching your Github Personal Access Token\n",
    "So you don't have to enter your personal access token each time you want to push to Github, follow this resource for your operating system: https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-all\n",
    "\n",
    "For Mac, use keychain. For Windows, use the [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows). For Linux, use [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret).

    "1. You can install libsecret and the development libraries with:\n",
