    "1. Open the command line and type `python` and press enter. Your command prompt should change to something like `>>>`. This means you are in interactive Python. Type `print(\"Hello World!\")` and press enter. You should see \"Hello World!\" echoed back out on the console. Congrats! You just wrote and executed your first line of Python code.

    "    1. `help(print)`: You can type the name of any identifier between the parens of the `help()` command to learn more about the Python construct.\n",
    "    1. `pwd()`: Tells you the \"present working directory\" where Python is executing\n",
    "    1. `x = 5`: Declare a variable named `x` and assign it the value 5\n",
    "    1. `type(x)`: Returns the data type of the value stored in variable `x`. What is it?\n",
    "    1. `course_name = \"AHA\"`: Declare a variable named `course_name` and assigns it the string \"AHA\"\n",
    "    1. `type(course_name)`\n",
    "    1. `course_name.<tab>`: Type the variable name `course_name` and a dot. Then press tab. IPython will provide you with all of the available information and behaviors associated with this variable. We will learn much more about this information later in the course.\n",
    "    1. `course_name.upper()`: What does `upper()` do?\n",
    "    1. `dir()`: Lists the known objects (variables) in Python. Do you see your variable names?\n",

    "1. Run the program! You can do this by pressing F5 on your keyboard or selecting Debug -> Start Debugging. The output of your code will be in the Terminal. Congrats! You just wrote and executed your first Python *script*.\n",
