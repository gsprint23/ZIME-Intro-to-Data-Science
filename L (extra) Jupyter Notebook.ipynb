    "## Overview of Jupyter Lab and Notebook\n",
    "According to the [Jupyter website](http://jupyter.org/):\n",
    "\n",
    ">JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. The Jupyter notebook combines two components:\n",
    "1. A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.\n",
    "1. Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Main Features of the Web Application\n",
    "* In-browser editing for code, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion/introspection.\n",
    "* The ability to execute code from the browser, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them.\n",
    "* Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations, such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc. For example, publication-quality figures rendered by the matplotlib library, can be included inline.\n",
    "* In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language, which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text.\n",
    "* The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Notebook Documents\n",
    "Notebook documents contains the inputs and outputs of a interactive session as well as additional text that accompanies the code but is not meant for execution. In this way, notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich representations of resulting objects. These documents are internally JSON files and are saved with the .ipynb extension. Since JSON is a plain text format, they can be version-controlled and shared with colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including HTML (for example, for blog posts), reStructuredText, LaTeX, PDF, and slide shows, via the nbconvert command.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Furthermore, any .ipynb notebook document available from a public URL can be shared via the Jupyter Notebook Viewer (nbviewer). This service loads the notebook document from the URL and renders it as a static web page. The results may thus be shared with a colleague, or as a public blog post, without other users needing to install the Jupyter notebook themselves. In effect, nbviewer is simply nbconvert as a web service, so you can do your own static conversions with nbconvert, without relying on nbviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on Jupyter Notebooks and their purpose, please read the [documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks in this Class\n",
    "You are already somewhat familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, this is one! I write my notes in Jupyter Notebook because I can interleave nicely typeset explanations of code with the actual code and its output. We are going to cover Jupyter Notebooks for three main reasons:\n",
    "1. You can *run* my notes rather just *view* them on nbviewer\n",
    "1. You can create your own notebooks for assignments, especially assignments with plots\n",
    "    * Note: for some assignments in this class you will be required to use Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "1. Jupyter Notebooks are popular in the data science community. \n",
    "    * They are used to tell *stories* about data. There is a nice post describing data storytelling, [\"Building a data science portfolio: Storytelling with data\"](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-project/) by Vik Paruchuri. The following text is an excerpt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data science is fundamentally about communication. You'll discover some insight in the data, then figure out an effective way to communicate that insight to others, then sell them on the course of action you propose. One of the most critical skills in data science is being able to tell an effective story using data. An effective story can make your insights much more compelling, and help others understand your ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A story in the data science context is a narrative around what you found, how you found it, and what it means. An example might be the discovery that your company's revenue has dropped 20% in the last year. Its not enough to just state that fact – you’ll have to communicate why revenue dropped, and how to potentially fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The main components of storytelling with data are:\n",
    "* Understanding and setting the context\n",
    "* Exploring multiple angles\n",
    "* Using compelling visualizations\n",
    "* Using varied data sources\n",
    "* Having a consistent narrative\n",
    "\n",
    ">The best tool to effectively tell a story with data is Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Big companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM use Jupyter Notebook, so learning to use Notebooks will make you more marketable!\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is included in the Anaconda Python distribution you installed for this class."

    "### Notebook Editor\n",
    "Notebooks will open in the Notebook editor. When you create a new notebook document, you will be presented with the notebook name, a menu bar, a tool bar and an empty code cell.\n",
    "* Notebook name: The name of the notebook document is displayed at the top of the page, next to the IP[y]: Notebook logo. This name reflects the name of the .ipynb notebook document file. Clicking on the notebook name brings up a dialog which allows you to rename it. Thus, renaming a notebook from \"Untitled0\" to \"My first notebook\" in the browser, renames the Untitled0.ipynb file to My first notebook.ipynb.\n",
    "* Menu bar: The menu bar presents different options that may be used to manipulate the way the notebook functions.\n",
    "* Tool bar: The tool bar gives a quick way of performing the most-used operations within the notebook, by clicking on an icon.\n",

    "### How to Learn More\n",
    "If you would like to learn more about the specific elements within Jupyter Notebook, you can go to the JupyterLab Reference docs by selecting Help in the menu bar then selecting JupyterLab Reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "The notebook consists of a sequence of cells. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using Shift-Enter, or by clicking either the \"Play\" button the toolbar, or Cell | Run in the menu bar. The execution behavior of a cell is determined the cell's type. There are four types of cells:\n",
    "1. code cells\n",
    "1. markdown cells\n",
    "1. raw cells\n",
    "1. heading cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a drop-down on the toolbar (which will be \"Code\", initially), or via keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Cells\n",
    "When a code cell is executed, code that it contains is sent to the kernel associated with the notebook. The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell's output. The output is not limited to text, with many other possible forms of output are also possible, including [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) figures and HTML tables (as used, for example, in the [Pandas data analysis package](http://pandas.pydata.org/)). \n",

    "#### Markdown Cells\n",
    "(This is an example Markdown cell.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can document the computational process in a literate way, alternating descriptive text with code, using rich text. In Jupyter Notebook this is accomplished by marking up text with the [Markdown markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The corresponding cells are called Markdown cells. The Markdown language provides a simple way to perform this text markup, that is, to specify which parts of the text should be emphasized (italics), bold, form lists, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Markdown cell is executed, the Markdown code is converted into the corresponding formatted rich text. Markdown allows arbitrary HTML code for formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Markdown cells, you can also include mathematics in a straightforward way, using standard [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) notation: `$...$` for in line mathematics and `$$...$$` for displayed mathematics. When the Markdown cell is executed, the LaTeX portions are automatically rendered in the HTML output as equations with high quality typography. This is made possible by MathJax, which supports a large subset of LaTeX functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Latex Overview\n",
    "[Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) is a markup language to typeset documents. Specifically, Latex is really good at typesetting *math*. We are going to use Latex in our Markdown cells to render beautiful mathematical formulas. How we are going to use Latex only scratches the surface of what Latex can be used for (i.e. writing entire papers, as an alternative to Microsoft Word). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Latex Math Mode\n",
    "To enter Latex code in a Markdown cell, we need to enter \"math mode\", which is prefacing our Latex code with the \\\\$ symbol for inline Latex, and \\$\\$ for block Latex. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The word pi in Latex, $pi$, looks more \"mathy\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would render as:\n",
    "\n",
    "The word pi in Latex, $pi$, looks more \"mathy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And block Latex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The word pi in Latex\n",
    "$$pi$$\n",
    "is now centered and on its own line.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would render as:\n",
    "\n",
    "The word pi in Latex\n",
    "\n",
    "$$pi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is now centered and on its own line.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Latex Functionality\n",
    "Enter/exit math mode: \\\\$ for inline math and \\$\\$ for block math\n",
    "\n",
    "Subscript: follow text with `_{text to be subscripted}`\n",
    "* Example: `$x_{i + 1}$` will be rendered as $x_{i + 1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Superscript: follow text with `^{text to be superscripted}`\n",
    "* Example: `$x^{i + 1}$` will be rendered as $x^{i + 1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbols over characters: use \\overline, \\bar, \\widehat, or ' (prime)\n",
    "* Example: `$\\overline{x}$` will be rendered as $\\overline{x}$\n",
    "* Example: `$\\widehat{x}$` will be rendered as $\\widehat{x}$\n",
    "* Example: `$x'$` will be rendered as $x'$\n",
    "\n",
    "Special characters: backslash and the name, which you probably will have to Google\n",
    "* Example: `$\\pi$` will be rendered as $\\pi$\n",
    "* Example: `$\\times$` will be rendered as $\\times$\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractions: \\frac{numerator}{denominator}\n",
    "* Example: `$\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$` will be rendered as $\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Square root: `$\\sqrt{2}$` will be rendered as $\\sqrt{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sums: `$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-n}$` will be rendered as $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Latex Escaping Characters\n",
    "Often characters/symbols have special meaning in Markdown. For example \\\\$ denotes Latex math mode. Sometimes we really do want a \\$ in our paragraphs! To do this, you can escape the functionality of a character by placing one (or sometimes two) backslash(es) in front of the character. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \\\\\\\\ `\\\\`$ will render as \\\\ \\\\$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, I sometimes use inline code to escape built-in functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \\`$\\` will render as `$`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Other Latex Functionality\n",
    "Latex is capable of so much more! I recommend following a tutorial online to learn more. [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) is a great resource to learn more. For now, you know enough to typeset basic math formulas."

We recommend using only one markdown header in a cell and limit the cell's content to the header text.

    "Typically, you will work on a computational problem in pieces, organizing related ideas into cells and moving forward once previous parts work correctly. This is much more convenient for interactive exploration than breaking up a computation into scripts that must be executed together, as was previously necessary, especially if parts of them take a long time to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing Jupyter Notebooks, you will alternate between describing a procedure in a Markdown cell and implementing a procedure in a code cell. All actions in the notebook can be performed with the mouse, but keyboard shortcuts are also available for the most common ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "The essential shortcuts to remember are the following:\n",
    "* Shift-Enter: run cell\n",
    "    * Execute the current cell, show output (if any), and jump to the next cell below. If Shift-Enter is invoked on the last cell, a new code cell will also be created. Note that in the notebook, typing Enter on its own never forces execution, but rather just inserts a new line in the current cell. Shift-Enter is equivalent to clicking the Cell | Run menu item.\n",
    "* Ctrl-Enter: run cell in-place\n",
    "    * Execute the current cell as if it were in \"terminal mode\", where any output is shown, but the cursor remains in the current cell. The cell's entire contents are selected after execution, so you can just start typing and only the new input will be in the cell. This is convenient for doing quick experiments in place, or for querying things like filesystem content, without needing to create additional cells that you may not want to be saved in the notebook.\n",
    "* Alt-Enter: run cell, insert below\n",
    "    * Executes the current cell, shows the output, and inserts a new cell between the current cell and the cell below (if one exists). This is thus a shortcut for the sequence Shift-Enter, Ctrl-m a. (Ctrl-m a adds a new cell above the current one.)\n",
    "* Esc and Enter: Command mode and edit mode\n",
    "    * In command mode, you can easily navigate around the notebook using keyboard shortcuts. In edit mode, you can edit text in cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Command mode command shortcuts:\n",
    "* a: insert a cell above\n",
    "* b: insert a cell below\n",
    "* m: convert cell to markdown cell\n",
