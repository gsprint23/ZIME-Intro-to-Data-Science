    "## The Command Line\n",
    "Instead of using graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to interface with our OS, we can type commands at the command line (AKA powershell (Windows) or terminal (Unix-based machines). The OS you use determines what commands are available. The three main OSs in use today are Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Both Mac OS X and Linux are Unix-based OSs, meaning they are derived from the [Unix OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix). In this lesson, we are going to cover several OS commands for both Windows and Unix-based machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launching Powershell/Terminal\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "Either one of these methods will launch powershell in Windows:\n",
    "1. Hit the Windows key then type \"powershell\" and press enter.\n",
    "1. Open up the start menu and navigate to All Apps -> Windows System -> Powershell\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unix-based\n",
    "Either one of these methods will launch a terminal in Unix-based machines:\n",
    "1. Hit the command key and then type \"terminal\" and press enter.\n",
    "1. Open the applications folder, then open the Utilities folder, then select the Terminal application.\n",
    "1. Ctrl + Alt + T\n",
    "\n",
    "## Command Help\n",
    "`man <command>` (short for interface to the online reference manuals): get help for `<command>`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "man man\n",
    "```\n",
    "provides the instructions on how to use the `man` command (quite long to include).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: many commands have different options you can specify using a *switch*. In Windows a switch is specified using the forward slash, such as `/i` to ignore case. In Unix-based machines, a switch is specified using a dash, such as `-i` to ignore case."

    "## Navigating the File System\n",
    "Your OS manages your file system. You can think of a file system as a tree structure, with the root node being the top-level folder (e.g. C:\\ on Windows or / on Unix-based machines). Child nodes of the root node are folders/files in the top-level folder, and so on and so forth. Leaf nodes are files and empty folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically use a GUI such as Windows Explorer or Finder to access our files, manage our files, etc. All of the common tasks we use GUIs for have equivalent command line commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Working Directory\n",
    "When you launch the command line, the command line is operating in a folder (AKA a directory). The current folder is called the *current working directory*, or the CWD. At the command lint, to the left of the cursor is the actual prompt, which denotes the CWD. You can also display the CWD with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pwd` (short for present working directory): print the full filename of the current working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "gsprint@gsprint-x1:~/Documents/L1-2$ pwd\n",
    "/home/gsprint/Documents/L1-2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paths\n",
    "When you refer to a file or folder by name, the OS looks for it in the CWD.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a file you want to interact with is in a directory other than the CWD, you will have to specify its path. The location of a file is represented by its path, the sequence of folders that the file is stored in, plus the file's name. There are two ways to specify a path:\n",
    "1. Relative path: a path to a file or directory relative to the current directory.\n",
    "1. Absolute path: a path to a file or directory specified by its exact location on your file system. An absolute path *uniquely* identifies the location of a file/folder on a file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "On a windows machine, folders and file names in a path are separated by backslashes \"\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative path example: \"files\\transactions.txt\" refers to a file (\"transactions.txt\") in a directory (\"files\") in the CWD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute path example:  \"C:\\Users\\gsprint\\cpts215\\lessons\\files\\transactions.txt\" refers to a file (\"transactions.txt\") in the folder \"C:\\Users\\gsprint\\cpts215\\lessons\\files\" on my C:\\ drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Windows' absolute paths start with the drive, such as C:\\, as the top-level directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: On a windows machine, folders and file names in a path are separated by backslashes \"\\\". We know the backslash has a special purpose in Python, to escape certain characters, such as a newline \"\\n\"; therefore, you will have to escape a backslash: \"`\\\\`\" in your path to a file: `\"files\\\\transactions.txt\"`. Alternatively, you can specify your path as a raw string: `r\"files\\transactions.txt\"`. On a Unix-based machine (e.g. Mac, Linux distributions), the forward slash \"/\" is used in paths and you don't have to worry about this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unix-based\n",
    "On a Unix-based machine, the forward slash \"/\" is used in paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative path example: \"files/transactions.txt\" refers to a file (\"transactions.txt\") in a directory (\"files\") in the CWD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute path example:  \"/home/gsprint/cpts215/lessons/files/transactions.txt\" refers to a file (\"transactions.txt\") in the folder \"/home/gsprint/cpts215/lessons/files/transactions.txt\" on my hard drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Unix-based absolute paths start with root, /, as the top-level directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The CWD can be referred to by a single period, `.`. The folder the CWD is in (i.e. CWD's parent folder) can be referred to by two periods, `..`. We will learn more about this when we talk about changing the CWD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List of Files in the CWD\n",
    "To display the files/folders in the CWD:\n",
    "* `ls`: prints a listing\n",
    "* `ls -`l: prints a long listing (includes more details about the files/folders)\n",
    "* `ls -R`: prints a visualization of the the folders/files in the CWD and all subfolders recursively\n",
    "\n",
