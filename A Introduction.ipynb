The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.\n",

    "## Python\n",
    "In this class, we are going to learn and use the Python programming language. According to [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022), Python is the top programming language (as of 2022) and according to [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/02/data-science-programming-languages.html), Python is the top programming language for analytics, data mining, and data science (with SQL and R close by). \n",

    "1. Easy to learn\n",
    "1. Free, open source\n",
    "1. Support for the life cycle of software (prototyping, development, testing, release, maintenance)\n",
    "1. Many available libraries, especially for data analytics:\n",
    "    1. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "    1. [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)\n",
    "    1. [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "    1. [Plotting libraries](https://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific/Plotting), such as [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)\n",
    "    1. [sci-kits](https://scikits.appspot.com/) (especially [sci-kit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning)\n",
    "1. Many supported GUI backends\n",
    "1. LOTS of community support/development online\n",
    "1. Cross platform support\n",
    "    * Python is an interpreted language, which means it can run on any system with the Python interpreter installed; however, this is also a disadvantage in some ways, meaning Python code can be slow to run, compared with compiled languages like C"
